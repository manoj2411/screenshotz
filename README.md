screenshotz
===========

A sample app to capture screenshots from url. User after logging in can take screenshot of webpages by entering the url and can share it via a special unique url. I am using [screencap](https://github.com/maxwell/screencap) gem to take screenshots which is using Phantom.js under the hood.
